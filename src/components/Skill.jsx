                            I am an undergraduate student in the Elmore Family
                            School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at
                            Purdue University. I am a member of the Convergence
                            Design Lab, where I work as an undergraduate
                            research assistant. My research interests are
                            Human-AI interaction and its practical applications,
                            with a specific focus on Extended Reality, Task
                            Guidance Systems, and AI-infused interfaces.
